**My name is John Robbins**
Everyone I know personally calls me JP though, and I prefer it that way. At the time of writing this I am a 29 year old stay at home dad. Previously, I worked as an HVAC Service Technician specializing in Commercial Refrigeration and Kitchen equipment repair, but that changed in september of 2022 when I dropped a refrigeration unit on my arm and severed a few tendons and a nerve. Since then I have shifted my sights to something a little easier on my body and I am trying to learn web development. I have two beautiful children and a saint of a wife who I adore.

\* Life After HVAC\*\*
Since I have been off work my entire life has been flipped on its head. My wife is now a traveling nurse and I went from working large amounts of overtime and barely spending any time at home to taking a backseat. It has definitly been an adjustment, but being able to spend time with my kids and wife has been well worth it.

\* Looking to the future\*\*

In the future I am looking to get a job doing web development. I am excited about the new challenges that lay ahead of me, and thankful I am in a position to take this opportunity.
